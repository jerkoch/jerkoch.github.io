I finally got around to setting up my development blog.  I've been meaning to do this forever, but never got around to it. So why now?  Mainly selfish reasons. These days I'm all Swift, all the time. It's been really exciting experiencing the evolution of such young language. I've learned a ton from a number of great community members, and I want a place to record all the useful tips, tricks, and code snippets that I come across. If that helps anyone else, then great!

My latest adventure was selecting and setting up my blogging infrastructure. I landed on [Jekyll][jeykll]. Dead simple, static, markdown, and free hosting on GitHub. Done. I found a nice Jeykll port of Ghost's default theme, appropriately named [Kasper][kasper].  After a little bit of tweaking, I'm pretty happy with the layout.  

Now I just need to write my first technical post... stay tuned!
